# MarketPlace_For_You<br><br>

To start the project, clone the project into your drive. Start Docker Compose. <br>
To open swagger ui, launch http://localhost:35010/swagger/index.html into your web browser. Make sure docker is installed and marketplaceforyou.api and marketplaceforyou.db is running.<br>

Authorization has been currently removed so you can test out the APIs as you would like. 
File upload APIs are current not working as I have shutdown my AWS account associated with this project and removed all related services to avoid server cost.
