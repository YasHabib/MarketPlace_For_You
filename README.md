# MarketPlace_For_You<br><br>

To start the project, clone the project into your drive. Set Docker Compose as your startup project. <br>
Start debugging<br>
To open swagger ui, launch http://localhost:35010/swagger/index.html into your web browser. **Swagger UI is not set to automatically upon upon debugging**. Make sure docker is installed and marketplaceforyou.api and marketplaceforyou.db is running.<br>

**important**<br>
Few APIs may not work as the Auth0 account used for this project was associated with my work email which I currently do not have access to. Hence authorization has been currently removed so you can test out the APIs without using a bearer token. Also checking the logged in userId also has been removed.

File upload API is current not working as I have shutdown my AWS account associated with this project and removed all related services to avoid server cost.
